# Directory /src/data_processing/
Updated: 04/23/18

This directory contains four sub-directories which contain scripts used for dataset
processing. Descriptions for each sub-directory can be found below.

## Sub-Directories

- [/pdb_extract/](src/data_processing/pdb_extract) : This sub-directory contains scripts
used to extract Protein Data Bank (PDB) files from Rosetta silent files, a commonly
used method of compressing PDB data.

- [/scoring/](scoring) : This sub-directory contains scripts
used to calculate the GDT-TS scores for a given decoy dataset. Documentation on
how to use these scripts can be found within the directory.

- [/pairwise_generation/](src/data_processing/pairwise_generation) : This sub-directory
contains scripts used for generating pairwise distance feature maps. Documentation on
how to use these scripts can be found within the directory.

- [/torsion_generation/](src/data_processing/torsion_generation) : This sub-directory
contains scripts used for generating torsion angle feature maps decoy structures.
